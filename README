Welcome to Upgen.

Upgen is a general-purpose scanner and parser generator that converts an Upgen script into a program in high-level
 programming languages (currently, only C++ and Object Pascal available). The major purpose of Upgen is to merge
 scanner generator and parser generator into a single tool, and generate programs in different programming languages.
By merging scanner and parser, interfaces between them are hidden from users, and therefore make the tool easier
 to use. Besides, Upgen can generate stand-alone scanner program or parser program by setting proper options.
