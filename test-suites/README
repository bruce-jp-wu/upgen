1 Files in the package of test suites
-------------------------------------
1) c++test: the command to perform test cases written in C++
2) pastest: the command to peform test cases written in Obect Pascal
3) pas-script: the test script that contains all the test cases in C++
4) cpp-script: the test script that contains all the test cases in Object Pascal
5) genscript.upg: the Upgen script used to build a tool (its name is genscript)
to create test suites from test script.

2 Pre-requirements
------------------
1) GNU C++ and libstdc++ (4.1.2 or above)
2) GNU building system: autoconf (2.61 or above), automake (1.10 or above)
3) Free pascal compiler: fpc 2.40, (for test suites in Object Pascal)
4) upgen, must be installed at /usr/bin


3 How to test
-------------
For test suites in C++, just invoke `c++test'; for Object Pascal, invoke `pastest'.
The syntax of the two commands is:
	command action_type suite_type
where command is either `c++test' or `pastest';
action_type has following two possible legal values:
	make -- only create test suites
	test -- create test suites and run all test cases
suite_type has following six possible legal values:
	file -- indicate input of every test case in the test suites is from a file
	stdin -- indicate input of every test case is the test suites from standard input
	buffer -- indicate input of every test case is the test suites from a string buffer.
	cbuffer -- indicate input of every test case is the test suites from a string buffer,
               but the scanner has its own inner buffer by copying the input string buffer.
	all -- all types of suites above are created
	clean -- remove test suites and their logs

The test results are stored .log files in the director ./upgen_test_log/.

Here is some examples.
1) To create a test suite in which all test cases parses text from a file, the command is
	c++test make file (C++)
	pastest make file (Object Pascal)
2) To run all test suites, the command is
	c++test test all (C++)
	pastest test all (Object Pascal)
